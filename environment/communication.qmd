# Communication 

1. Dr. Verbruggen relies primarily upon email for communication, and generally responds quickly to
emails unless traveling or away from work. Unless otherwise agreed (e.g., for field work), alternative communication channels (such as Slack, Signal, or Whatsapp) should only be used for non-urgent or non-work-related messages. 
2. A lot of the research involves team work, so communication is key. For large collaborative projects, regular updates should be shared with the whole team. 
3. If you expect a direct response or action, use the “To” field; if you want to keep people in the loop in a transparent way, use the “Cc” field.
4. As a general rule, place the PI and co-Is (or PhD supervisors) in cc in all important team conversations and communications with external partners.
