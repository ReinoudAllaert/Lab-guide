## Communication 

1. Ir. Verbruggen primarily relies upon email for communication, and generally responds quickly to
emails unless traveling or away from work. Unless otherwise agreed (e.g., for field work), alternative communication channels (such as Slack, Signal, or Whatsapp) should only be used for non-urgent or non-work-related messages. 
2. Our projects often involve several team members. Project updates can be shared at lab meetings and ad hoc project meetings. For large collaborative projects, updates should also be shared via email with the whole team at a regular basis, as some collaborators may not be able to join all meetings. 
3. If you expect a direct response or action to an email, use the “To” field; if you want to keep people in the loop in a transparent way, use the “Cc” field.
4. As a general rule, place the PI and co-Is (or PhD supervisors) in cc in all important team conversations and communications with external partners.
