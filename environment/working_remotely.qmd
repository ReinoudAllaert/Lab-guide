## Working remotely

1.  We support the needs of lab members who must work remotely.   
2.  Any remote work must be first discussed with Dr. Verbruggen. 
3. Following this discussion, telework requests can be formalised in a telework charter, in accordance with [UGent's policies]

More information about UGent's telework framework can be found on the [intranet](https://www.ugent.be/intranet/en/workplace-buildings/teleworking).
