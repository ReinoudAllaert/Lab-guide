## Lab meetings

1.  All researchers in the lab are expected to attend the bi-weekly lab meetings, except in cases of
    unavoidable conflict. The meetings generally last 1-2 hours. 
2.  At the beginning of each meeting, all the members are invited to share the main activities of the
    past two weeks. 
3.  This progress overview is followed by an activity, such as a presentation of research projects or data; a talk by an external
    speaker; or a discussion of specific research papers. 
4.  For each meeting, another lab member will be in charge of organizing such an activity. Lab members can decide whether they want to present something themselves or invite others. 
5. The lab meeting schedule (time, place, organizers) will be determined at the beginning of the term. 
6.  In addition to the regular (research-based) lab meetings, we also aim to organize at least one 'social event' for the whole lab per term.
