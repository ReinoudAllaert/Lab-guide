title: "About us"

The aim of the new Cognition, Behavior, and Ecology (CoBE) lab @UGent is to provide novel insights in an age-old problem, namely how and why humans and non-human animals differ in their ability to control their behavior in complex social and physical environments.

Our interdisciplinary team is embedded in the Faculty of Psychology, but we closely collaborate with colleagues from the Faculty of Sciences (biology & ecology) and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.
