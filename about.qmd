The aim of the new Cognition, Behavior, and Ecology (CoBE) lab @UGent is to provide novel insights in an age-old problem, namely how and why humans and non-human animals differ in their ability to control their behavior in complex social and physical environments.

Our interdisciplinary lab is embedded in the Faculty of Psychology, but we closely collaborate with colleagues from the Faculty of Sciences (biology & ecology) and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Furthermore, we have interdisciplanry collaborations with researchers at other national and international universities, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO Vlaanderen), and with the Wildlife Rescue Centre Ostend, where are avian research facilities are based.   

The lab also aims to be at the forefront the forefront of good research practices and Open Science. Where possible and useful, we preregister confirmatory studies and analysis protocols, and share the raw data, code, and experimental materials. Furthermore, we have
establish a ‘co-pilot system’, whereby members of the research team check each other’s code and rerun (parts of) the analysis. We hope that these practices will further promote transparency, openness, reproducibility, and scientific integrity.
