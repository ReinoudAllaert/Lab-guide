    "text": "All products of research at Stanford (including data and code) are the property of the University. However, faculty have wide latitude to release software as open source under the University’s open source policy, as long as it doesn’t conflict with any other obligations. Students are allowed to release code under an open source license at Stanford with faculty permission; students in the Poldracklab have blanket permission to do so, as all of our code is intended to be made open available, as discussed in the section on code sharing. After leaving the lab, trainees can continue to reuse any code or other research materials (e.g. stimuli) developed as part of their work in the lab as long as the code has been released under an open source license and they continue to abide by the terms of the license.\nAs discussed in the section on data management and sharing, all data collected within our laboratory is meant to be shared upon submission of the related paper. In cases where these data can be deidentified they will be shared under a public domain dedication (CC0), which places no restrictions on their use by other researchers. Thus, any researcher can continue to use those data once they leave the lab. In other cases it may be necessary to restrict data sharing (e.g. when the data cannot be deidentified), in which case researchers will need to obtain a data use agreement from Stanford in order to access those data at their new institution. Dr. Poldrack commits to supporting any such requests, unless they violate other obligations of his or the University.\nIn many cases we use data within the lab under Data Use Agreements (such as the ABCD or HCP datasets), and any researcher wishing to use such datasets must be explcitly listed on the DUA. Once a researcher is no longer included in the Stanford DUA for a particular dataset, they must no longer access the dataset via Stanford computer systems.\n\n\nWhen a trainee leaves the lab, there is often uncertainty about which ideas are theirs to pursue independently and which must be pursued in collaboration with their former mentor. It is difficult to specify a blanket policy on this issue, as it will depend on many different circumstances. Trainees are encouraged to discuss this issue openly with Dr. Poldrack prior to departing the lab, to prevent any misunderstandings. In many cases Dr. Poldrack will be happy for the trainee to take the ideas and pursue them independently in their new position; this has happened on a number of occasions. In other cases, particularly when the ideas were developed in close collaboration with Dr. Poldrack, there may be an expectation that further development of the ideas will occur through collaborative efforts."

In these cases, the researcher will ask Dr. Poldrack or another lab member to generate a simulated dataset based on their actual data (e.g. by randomly shuffling the observations of each variable to create a knockoff dataset that maintains each variable’s marginal distribution), prior to any analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen possible, all data analyses should be replicated by an independent analyst who is blind to the results of the initial analysis.\nIf discordant results are observed, then the analysts will work together to determine their source, and whether they reflect error versus true analytic variability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll analysis procedures should be implemented in code and runnable with a single command.\nWe aim to avoid any analyses that involve manual intervention.

Our lab is embedded in the Faculty of Psychology, but within Ghent University, we closely collaborate with colleagues from the Faculty of Sciences (biology & ecology) and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Furthermore, we have interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers at other national and international universities, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO Vlaanderen), and with the Wildlife Rescue Centre Ostend, where our avian research facilities are located.\nThe lab also aims to be at the forefront of good research practices and Open Science. Where possible and useful, we preregister confirmatory studies and analysis protocols, and share the raw data, code, and experimental materials. Furthermore, we have established a ‘co-pilot system’, whereby members of the research team check e.g., each other’s code or rerun (parts of) the analysis.

    "text": "I have biweekly individual meetings with all lab members. These individual meetings alternate with the lab meetings. The timing of the meetings is discussed at the beginning of the term.\nFor PhD students, the co-supervisor(s) will also be invited to the individual supervision meetings (if applicable). After each meeting, the PhD students write a short summary of the meeting, which is uploaded to a folder that is accessible to the whole supervision team.\nI try hard to create a healthy working atmosphere, in which lab members feel comfortable talking about troubling issues.\nIn addition to these ‘fixed’ bi-weekly meetings, I have an ‘open door’ policy, meaning that lab members are welcome to ask questions or discuss issues at any time. But for important issues or discussions, it might be advisable to schedule an ad hoc meeting so that there is sufficient time.\nOnce a year, there is also a longer ‘developmental meeting’, in which we discuss progress for the past year, and both short-term and long-term plans."

    "text": "Ir. Verbruggen primarily relies upon email for communication, and generally responds quickly to emails unless traveling or away from work. Unless otherwise agreed (e.g., for field work), alternative communication channels (such as Slack, Signal, or Whatsapp) should only be used for non-urgent or non-work-related messages.\nOur projects often involve several team members. Project updates can be shared at lab meetings and ad hoc project meetings. For large collaborative projects, updates should also be shared via email with the whole team at a regular basis, as some collaborators may not be able to join all meetings.\nIf you expect a direct response or action to an email, use the “To” field; if you want to keep people in the loop in a transparent way, use the “Cc” field.\nAs a general rule, place the PI and co-Is (or PhD supervisors) in cc in all important team conversations and communications with external partners."

    "text": "Most postdocs in the lab are funded through postdoctoral fellowships or grants that they write themselves.\n\nSome postdocs are funded through existing grants. In this case, the postdoc must spend a significant portion of their time working on that project. However, the lab also provides postdocs the room to develop their own ideas.\n\n\n\nWe have the opportunity to request Diversity Supplements for our NIH grants. If you qualify for such a fellowship (which includes individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, disadvantaged backgrounds, or rural/low-income areas), please contact Dr. Poldrack to discuss your interest."

Be sure to send your CV, and explain in brief your research interests and why you think you would be a good fit for the lab.\nWe are particularly interested in hiring postdocs who bring diversity to the lab, either through their personal identity, research interests, or experience."
