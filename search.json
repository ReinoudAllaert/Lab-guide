For more general WRC-related issues, Reinoud Allaert will provide additional support. In the past, we have had issues where requests were coming from multiple members of our lab, which was not being sufficiently mindful of time and busy schedules of the support staff. Therefore, in general, you should not directly contact the lab’s support staff with discussing the request first with Dr. Verbruggen. See also the ‘communication’ section for further guidelines.\nOur lab is embedded within the Department of Experimental Psychology. The department provides formal and informal support at many levels. In general, admin related request can be addressed directly to Lies Baten; technical (computer) related requests should be addressed to Christophe Blankaert; and teaching/marking related requests should be addressed to Vicent Hoofs (see the departmental website for contact details).\nThere is also a departmental Slack channel, which can be useful for informal support requests as well (ranging from research-related questions to questions related to living in Ghent/Belgium etc.).\nOur team has strong connections with UGent’s Terrestrial Ecology Unit. For some projects, we can also rely on their administative support staff. Importantly, you should not directly contact the TEREC’s support staff with discussing the request first with Dr. Verbruggen and Dr. Lens.\nThe Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences provides all sorts of reseasrch support (e.g., statistical support, technical support, …). More information and contact details can be found on the webpage of the Research Support Office."

Click here for a full overview of the facilities provided by the department.\nRooms and equipment can be booked via the departmental website as well (employees only).\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiments with non-human animals (mostly avian species) are mostly conducted at the research facilities of Ghent University at the Wildlife Rescue Centre (WRC) Ostend. The WRC is an internationally renowned institution, which specializes in the rescue and rehabilitation of birds.\nThe lab has permanent access to:\n\n‘B-lofts’: 10 outdoor enclosures (10 m2 each)\n‘D-lofts’: 4 indoor (heated) enclosures (6 m2 each), each with an access to a separate outside enclosure (12 m2 per enclosure).\nA research room (18 m2), with two large test boxes and several smaller (Skinner) boxes.\nA multifunctional room (10 m2) for storage of samples (in freezers) and other research materials. This room can also temporarily house individual animals for short periods of time.\nA large flight cage (+- 110 m2; 7 m high)\nA modern office container, allowing researchers to work from the WRC when not testing animals.\n\nLab members also have access to state-of-the-art equipment, such as:\n\nLarge incubators and hatcheries\nVarious camera systems (including thermal imaging). All enclosures and flight cage(s) are also equipped with cameras, allowing us to monitor animals 24/7.\nAll equipment required for taking samples (e.g., blood or tissue samples) and preprosseing them (e.g. centrifuge)\nEquipment required to test animals in controlled environments, including touch screens and various custom-made devices (e.g., to detect force of pecks)\nGPS trackers for wild animals\nA tailored long range ultra-wide band (UWB) tracking system for monitoring individuals in enclosures and the flight cage.\n\nRequests for the use of research facilities and equipment at WRC should always be discussed first with Dr. Verbruggen and Dr. Lens. They will discuss such requests in an open and transparent way, ensuring that all team members will get the opportunity to conduct their research in a timely and optimal fashion. It is difficult to specify a blanket policy, but in general, priority will be given to grant-funded projects and PhD projects.\nFor similar reasons, long-term block-booking of all (or most) facilities or equipment for single projects is generally not allowed as we have to take the needs of the whole lab into account (i.e., in this case, ‘the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few’)."

Thus, research ideas are often developed with Dr. Verbruggen and other (senior and junior) team members.\nWhen a team member leaves the lab, there is often uncertainty about which ideas are theirs to pursue independently and which must be pursued in collaboration with other lab members. It is difficult to specify a blanket policy on this issue, as it will depend on many different circumstances. Lab members are encouraged to discuss this issue openly with Dr. Verbruggen prior to departing the lab, to prevent any misunderstandings. In many cases Dr. Verbruggen will be happy for the (former) lab member to take the ideas and pursue them independently in their new position; this has happened on a number of occasions. In other cases, particularly when the ideas were developed in close collaboration with Dr. Verbruggen, there may be an expectation that further development of the ideas will occur through collaborative efforts.\nLab members can not claim exclusive ownership over specific research topics, research methods, or study species. All lab members will have the opportunity to work on the topic they find most interesting (but see also the section on Funding), using the research methods and species that are considered most appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in the section on data management, all data collected within our laboratory is meant to be shared upon submission of the related paper. In cases where these data can be deidentified they will be shared under a public domain dedication (CC BY 4), which ‘allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator’. Thus, any researcher can continue to use those data once they leave the lab. In other cases it may be necessary to restrict data sharing (e.g. when the data cannot be deidentified), in which case researchers will need to obtain a data use agreement (see point 4 in the data sharing section).\nIn theory, research data may also be the subject of (technology) transfer efforts by the university as set out in the relevant legislation (cf. codex higher education and general regulation on collaboration and research of the Ghent University Association) if such research data may be suitable for commercialization or – more specifically - if such data may be protected by intellectual property rights. In this case, Dr. Verbruggen will first have to report the research data to the UGent TechTransfer office prior to any further dissemination (publication, presentation, …)."

All authors should agree on whether a correction or retraction is warranted, and promptly notify the journal of their recommendation and the nature of the error.\nIf applicable, a notification and corrected version of the article should also be submitted to the preprint server (e.g., bioRxiv or psyaRxiv), and internal copies of the paper should be corrected and versioned accordingly.\n\nThus, even tough we realise that committing errors can occur, dealing with them can be difficult (also at a personal level).

Our lab is embedded in the Faculty of Psychology, but within Ghent University, we closely collaborate with colleagues from the Faculty of Sciences (biology & ecology) and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Furthermore, we have interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers at other national and international universities, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO Vlaanderen), and with the Wildlife Rescue Centre Ostend, where our avian research facilities are located.\nThe lab also aims to be at the forefront of good research practices and Open Science. Where possible and useful, we preregister confirmatory studies and analysis protocols, and share the raw data, code, and experimental materials. Furthermore, we have established a ‘co-pilot system’, whereby members of the research team check e.g., each other’s code or rerun (parts of) the analysis.

For large collaborative projects, regular updates should also be shared via email with the whole team, as some collaborators may not be able to join all meetings.\nIf you expect a direct response or action to an email, use the “To” field; if you want to keep people in the loop in a transparent way, use the “Cc” field.\nAs a general rule, place the PI and co-Is (or PhD supervisors) in cc in all important team conversations.\nAll communication with the staff of the Wildlife Rescue Centre (where our avian research facilities are located) should should happen via Reinoud Allaert (our WRC liaison person), with Dr. Verbruggen and Dr. Lens in cc (or in special circumstances, directly via Dr. Verbruggen & Dr. Lens). In the past, we have had issues where (sometimes conflicting) requests were coming from multiple members of our lab, causing confusion and misunderstandings. Therefore, in general, you should not directly contact the WRC staff with requests (unless otherwise agreed beforehand)\nWhen contacting external partners or companies, Dr. Verbruggen should be informed as well (to avoid situations where he is contacted by these people without being aware of the original request). Thus, Dr. Verbruggen should also be cc’ed in those initial conversations (unless otherwise agreed beforehand)."

    "text": "Most Research Assistants and PhD students are (at least initially) funded through existing grants awarded to the PI or collaborators. The work of the PhD students is typically closely aligned with the goals and research aims of the overall project.\nPhD students can also apply for their own funding. For fellowships from the Research Foundation - Flanders and the Special Research Fund - Ghent University, this can still happen within the first year of the PhD.\nRA and PhD positions are often advertised, but MSc students interested in doing a PhD are invited to contact Dr. Verbruggen directly. Be sure to send your CV, and explain in brief your research interests and why you think you would be a good fit for the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost postdocs in the current lab are funded through postdoctoral fellowships or grants that they write themselves.\n\nSome postdocs can be funded through existing grants. In this case, the postdoc must spend a significant portion of their time working on that project. The lab will provide these postdocs the room to develop their own ideas, but still within the context of the project they are working on.\nPost-doc fellowships are generally not advertised by ourselves, so if you are interested in applying for a fellowship or personal grant within our team, contact Dr. Verbruggen directly. Be sure to send your CV, and explain in brief your research interests and why you think you would be a good fit for the lab.\nWe are particularly interested in hiring postdocs who bring diversity to our interdisciplinary team, either through their personal identity, research interests or background, or experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Foundation - Flanders (PhD & post-doc)\nSpecial Research Fund - Ghent University\nChina Scholarship Council (CSC; PhD only). Note: Ghent University has also signed a cooperation agreement with the China Scholarship Council (CSC) to stimulate Ghent University as host institution for Chinese PhD students.
